# GunViolenceDynamicServer
This is a dynamic server which I created with two of my classmates at the University of St. Thomas, Kevin and Anisa. By using templates and the sqlite3 database, we created graphs to show to statistics of gun violence sorted by state, day, and year. Much time was spent creating detailed queries in the server.js file and understanding how graph.js would insert the attribute values from the server into the html template.

Instructions for running code:
- Download Microsoft Visual Studtio Code
- Create a folder for the project root
- Clone the repository into the project folder
- In the project terminal run: npm install
- In the terminal run: node server.js
- In a web browser go to: localhost://8000
